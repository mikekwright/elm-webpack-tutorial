Elm and Webpack
===================================================

This repo holds the information, and code that will be used and discussed @ alianza's lunch'n'learn.   

## Getting Started

If you would like to follow along with this lunch'n'learn you will need to have an environment 
setup that can work with elm and webpack.  

In order to make this easier for everyone else as well I have created a docker image that
has the necessary tools for you to start creating a project using elm and webpack.  

### Container

To startup the container that you will use for this please run the following command.  

        docker run -it -v $PWD/src:/src mikewright/elm-dev /bin/bash
